# 0x11. C - printf

## An ALX team project written by Happy Chukwuma and Adioz Daniel

ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡

## TEST FILES ONLY

* All the test files are kept in this directory

### Architecture layout testing file

* This file helps test layout the architecture and skeleton testing for the team
* The rest of the features are plug and play; only if this test file works with the architecture

***main.c***

* To compile this file, use:

```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format main.c ../*.c -o printf```

**NOTE:** -Wno-format suppresses printf ```unknown conversion type character``` error while testing

* To run this file, use: ```./printf```
**Expected output:**

```C
Let's try to printf a simple sentence.

* At this stage, it does not support all the modifiers. But it should support most of them.

## 2. With a face like mine, I do better in print

* Handling the following custom conversion specifiers:
  * ```b```: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
* Test this conversion specifier with the ```2-main.c``` file
* To compile this file, use: ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format 2-main.c ../*.c```
* To run this test use: ```./a.out```

**Expected Output:**

```B
1100010
```

## 4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news

* In this section, we use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to minimize write function calls.
