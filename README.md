## Tasks

### 0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

This is a function that produces output according to a format.

* Prototype: ```int _printf(const char *format, ...);```
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* ```format``` is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See  ```man 3 printf``` for more detail.
* The following conversion specifiers are handled in this task:
  * ```c``` Prototype: ```int print_char(char c, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
  * ```s``` Prototype: ```int print_string(char *str, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
  * ```%``` Prototype: ```int print_percent(struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
* The buffer handling of the C library printf function is not reproduced at this stage
* The flag characters are not handled at this stage
* The field width is not handled at this stage
* Precision is not handled at this stage
* Length is not handled at this stage

### 1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't

This is a function that produces output according to a specified format.

* Prototype: ```int _printf(const char *format, ...);```
* Returns: the number of characters printed
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* ```format``` is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See  ```man 3 printf``` for more detail.
* The following conversion specifiers are handled in this task:
  * ```d``` Prototype: ```int print_integer(int value, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
  * ```i``` Prototype: ```int print_integer(int value, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```

### 2. With a face like mine, I do better in print

This function handles the specified format:
* Prototype: ```print_binary(unsigned int n, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
* Returns: the formatted unsigned decimal output
  * ```b:``` the unsigned int is converted to binary

### 3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print 
This function handles the specified format below:
  * ```u``` Prototype: ```int print_unsigned_decimal(unsigned int n, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
  * ```o``` Prototype: ```int print_octal(unsigned int n, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
  * ```x``` Prototype: ```int print_lowercase_hexadecimal(unsigned int n, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
  * ```X``` Prototype: ```int print_uppercase_hexadecimal(unsigned int n, struct PrintBuffer *pb);```
* Returns: the formatted specifier output

### 4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news

This Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call ```write``` as little as possible.
Added in ```main.h``` as ```#define WRITE_BUF_SIZE 1024```

### 5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
This handles the following specifier
  * ```S``` : prints the string.
  * Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: ```\x```, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)


* This task is developed without emphasis on the buffer handling of the C library printf function, this puts an exception that it may be handled in one way or another, or completely ignored.
* This task is developed without emphasis on handling the flag characters, this puts an exception that it may be handled in one way or another, or completely ignored.
* This task is developed without emphasis on handling field width, this puts an exception that it may be handled in one way or another, or completely ignored.
* This task is developed without emphasis on handling precision, this puts an exception that it may be handled in one way or another, or completely ignored.
* This task is developed without emphasis on handling the length modifiers, this puts an exception that it may be handled in one way or another, or completely ignored.
